These sources play a pivotal role in our transition to more sustainable and eco-friendly energy solutions.\nfor more info check out these links: https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-renewable-energy, https://www.edfenergy.com/energywise/renewable-energy-sources, https://www.energy.gov/eere/renewable-energy, https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/renewable-sources"

		  "The human brain is a highly complex organ responsible for processing information, controlling bodily functions, and enabling cognitive functions such as thinking, learning, and memory. It consists of billions of neurons that communicate through electrical and chemical signals. These neurons form intricate networks, allowing us to perceive the world, make decisions, and perform various tasks.\nYou can find out more about this at: https://www.mayoclinic.org/brain/sls-20077047, https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/anatomy-of-the-brain, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279302/, https://www.ageuk.org.uk/information-advice/health-wellbeing/mind-body/staying-sharp/your-brain/",
